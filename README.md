# Flex Flow

## Description

This app helps weightlifting trainees to create workout plans and track their progress.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 12
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- React
- Styled-Components

## Motivation

This is my final project of a 12 week Web Development Bootcamp at [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/en).
I've wanted to not only show my newly acquired Frontend skills, but also some
of my desire to work as a Full-Stack Developer. That's why I've used MongoDB
and Mongoose for my backend. It's been a wild ride and I am currently working
on a second version of this project using Next.js 13.
If all goes well, I will enroll in the Java Bootcamp also at [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/en).

## Biggest Challenge

Clean Code. I've been coding Frontend for the past two years and Clean Code
is my biggest pet peeve. That's why I've decided to create another version of
this app, focussing on keeping my code comprehensive and modular.
